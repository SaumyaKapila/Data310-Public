##Project 2
I think that one of the things that we have really lost during COVID is a sense of community and understanding of how our work impacts people in reality. For me and many of my peers, these past semesters have become all about work and nothing else; there is no joy from any of our work (everything is serious). That is what inspired me to do something silly for this project. I wanted this t-shirt design to be fun and remind ourselves that our work doesnâ€™t have to be serious and that this program is to learn!
